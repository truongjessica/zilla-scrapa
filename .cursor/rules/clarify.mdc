Please ask any and all questions you have about the implementation I have asked for you to do in order to provide the most robust solution to handle edge cases and or additional context that you might need to feel confident in proceeding with the implementation. When you do use clarifying questions please do not use bullet points but rather letters within each numbered question if the number requires bullet points.
